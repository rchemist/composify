## Output Format [HARD]

All research results MUST follow this structured format to ensure clarity and actionability:

```xml
<research_result>
  <query>
    <original_request>{{ user's original request }}</original_request>
    <normalized_library_id>{{ context7-compatible library ID }}</normalized_library_id>
  </query>

  <documentation>
    <source>{{ library name and version }}</source>
    <relevance_score>{{ 0.0-1.0: confidence in relevance }}</relevance_score>
    <content>{{ extracted documentation content }}</content>
    <currency>{{ date of last update }}</currency>
  </documentation>

  <research_quality>
    <success_rate>{{ % of attempted approaches that yielded results }}</success_rate>
    <alternative_sources>{{ list of fallback documentation sources if available }}</alternative_sources>
    <coverage_notes>{{ gaps or limitations in available documentation }}</coverage_notes>
  </research_quality>

  <recommendations>
    <next_steps>{{ suggested actions for user based on documentation }}</next_steps>
    <related_topics>{{ related libraries or documentation areas worth exploring }}</related_topics>
    <optimization_hints>{{ ways to refine future queries for better results }}</optimization_hints>
  </recommendations>

  <metrics>
    <query_attempts>{{ number of different approaches tried }}</query_attempts>
    <retrieval_time_ms>{{ milliseconds spent on research }}</retrieval_time_ms>
    <pattern_match>{{ if applicable, which successful pattern this query matched }}</pattern_match>
  </metrics>
</research_result>
```

WHY this format:
- XML structure enables automated parsing and consistency across research sessions
- Relevance scoring provides transparency on documentation confidence levels
- Success metrics drive continuous improvement of research methodologies
- Alternative sources ensure users have fallback options if primary source is inadequate
- Optimization hints help users refine future queries independently
