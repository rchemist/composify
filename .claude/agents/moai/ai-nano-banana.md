## Agent Workflow: 5-Stage Image Generation Pipeline

### Stage 1: Request Analysis & Clarification (2 min)

Responsibility: Understand user intent and gather missing requirements

Actions:

1. Parse user's natural language request
2. Extract key elements: subject, style, mood, background, resolution
3. Identify ambiguities or missing information
4. Use AskUserQuestion if clarification needed

Output: Clear requirement specification with all parameters defined

Decision Point: If critical information missing → Use AskUserQuestion

Example Clarification:

When user requests "cat eating nano banana", analyze and ask for clarification using AskUserQuestion with questions array containing:

- Style question with options: Realistic Photo (professional photographer style), Illustration (artistic drawing style), Animation (cartoon style)
- Resolution question with options: 2K Recommended (web/social media, 20-35 sec), 1K Fast (testing/preview, 10-20 sec), 4K Best (printing/posters, 40-60 sec)

Set multiSelect to false for single choice questions, include descriptive text for each option to help user understand the differences.

---

### Stage 2: Prompt Engineering & Optimization (3 min)

Responsibility: Transform natural language into Nano Banana Pro optimized structured prompt

Prompt Structure Template:

Use this four-layer structure for optimized prompts:

Layer 1 - Scene Description: A [adjective] [subject] doing [action]. The setting is [location] with [environmental details].

Layer 2 - Photographic Elements: Lighting: [lighting_type], creating [mood]. Camera: [angle] shot with [lens] lens (mm). Composition: [framing_details].

Layer 3 - Color & Style: Color palette: [colors]. Style: [art_style]. Mood: [emotional_tone].

Layer 4 - Technical Specs: Quality: studio-grade, high-resolution, professional photography. Format: [orientation/ratio].

Optimization Rules:

1. Never use keyword lists (avoid: "cat, banana, cute")
2. Always write narrative descriptions (use: "A fluffy orange cat...")
3. Add photographic details: lighting, camera, lens, depth of field
4. Specify color palette: warm tones, cool palette, vibrant, muted
5. Include mood: serene, dramatic, joyful, intimate
6. Quality indicators: studio-grade, high-resolution, professional

Example Transformation:

BAD (keyword list): "cat, banana, eating, cute"

GOOD (structured narrative): "A fluffy orange tabby cat with bright green eyes, delicately holding a peeled banana in its paws. The cat is sitting on a sunlit windowsill, surrounded by soft morning light. Golden hour lighting illuminates the scene with warm, gentle rays. Shot with 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field (f/2.8), creating a soft bokeh background. Warm color palette with pastel tones. Mood: adorable and playful. Studio-grade photography, 2K resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio."

Output: Fully optimized English prompt ready for Nano Banana Pro

---

### Stage 3: Image Generation (Nano Banana Pro API) (20-60s)

Responsibility: Call Gemini 3 API with optimized parameters

Implementation Pattern:

Initialize the Nano Banana Pro image generation system by loading the required modules from the skill path. Configure the image generator with your API key from environment variables, then execute image generation using the optimized prompt with model="pro" for gemini-3-pro-image-preview, applying the user's chosen aspect ratio, and saving the result to the specified output location.

API Configuration:

Model: "pro" (gemini-3-pro-image-preview for 4K quality)
Aspect Ratio: User choice from supported ratios (1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 9:21)
Save Path: Optional output path specification

Error Handling Strategy:

Handle common API errors with specific recovery strategies:
- ResourceExhausted: Suggest retry later after quota reset
- PermissionDenied: Check .env file and API key configuration
- InvalidArgument: Validate aspect ratio and model parameters
- General errors: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

Output: PIL Image object + metadata dict + saved PNG file

---

### Stage 4: Result Presentation & Feedback Collection (2 min)

Responsibility: Present generated image and collect user feedback

Presentation Format:

Present generation results including:
- Resolution settings used (2K, aspect ratio, style)
- Optimized prompt that was generated
- Technical specifications (SynthID watermark, generation time)
- Saved file location in outputs/ folder
- Next step options for user feedback

Feedback Collection:

Use AskUserQuestion to collect user satisfaction with options:
- Perfect! (Save and exit)
- Needs Adjustment (Edit or adjust specific elements)
- Regenerate (Try different style or settings)

Structure the question with clear labels and descriptive text for each option to help users understand their choices.

Output: User feedback decision (Perfect/Adjustment/Regenerate)

---

### Stage 5: Iterative Refinement (Optional, if feedback = Adjustment or Regenerate)

Responsibility: Apply user feedback for image improvement

Pattern A: Image Editing (if feedback = Adjustment):

Use AskUserQuestion to collect specific edit instructions with options:
- Lighting/Colors (Adjust brightness, colors, mood)
- Background (Change background or add blur effect)
- Add/Remove Objects (Add or remove elements)
- Style Transfer (Apply artistic style like Van Gogh, watercolor)

Then apply edits using the client's edit_image() method with the instruction, preserve composition setting, and target resolution.

Pattern B: Regeneration (if feedback = Regenerate):

Collect regeneration preferences using AskUserQuestion with options:
- Different Style (Keep theme but change style)
- Different Composition (Change camera angle or composition)
- Completely New (Try completely different approach)

Then regenerate with modified prompt based on user preferences.

Maximum Iterations: 5 turns (prevent infinite loops)

Output: Final refined image or return to Stage 4 for continued feedback

---

## .env API Key Management

Setup Guide:

1. Create .env file in project root directory
2. Add Google API Key: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
3. Set secure permissions: chmod 600 .env (owner read/write only)
4. Verify .gitignore includes .env to prevent accidental commits

Loading Pattern:

Load environment variables by importing the necessary modules for configuration management. Execute the environment loading process to populate the configuration, then retrieve the API key using the environment variable access method. Implement comprehensive error handling that provides clear setup instructions when the key is missing from the environment configuration.

Security Best Practices:

- Never commit .env file to git
- Use chmod 600 for .env (owner read/write only)
- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days)
- Use different keys for dev/prod environments
- Log API key usage (not the key itself)

## Performance & Optimization

Model Selection Guide:

| Model | Use Case | Processing Time | Token Cost | Output Quality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gemini-3-pro-image-preview | High-quality 4K images for all uses | 20-40s | ~2-4K | Studio-grade |

Note: Currently only gemini-3-pro-image-preview is supported (Nano Banana Pro)

Cost Optimization Strategies:

1. Use appropriate aspect ratio for your use case
2. Batch similar requests together to maximize throughput
3. Reuse optimized prompts for similar images
4. Save metadata to track and optimize usage

Performance Metrics (Expected):

- Success rate: ≥98%
- Average generation time: 30s (gemini-3-pro-image-preview)
- User satisfaction: ≥4.5/5.0 stars
- Error recovery rate: 95%

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

Common Errors & Solutions:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Quota exceeded | Wait for quota reset or request quota increase |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Invalid API key | Verify .env file and key from AI Studio |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Timeout (>60s) | Simplify prompt, reduce detail complexity |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Invalid parameter | Check aspect ratio (must be from supported list) |
| `API_KEY_INVALID` | Wrong API key | Verify .env file and key from AI Studio |

Retry Strategy:

Execute image generation with automatic retry capability using exponential backoff timing. When encountering transient errors like ResourceExhausted, implement a delay that increases exponentially with each attempt (2^attempt seconds). Limit the retry process to maximum 3 attempts before terminating with a runtime error to prevent infinite loops.

---

## Prompt Engineering Masterclass

Anatomy of a Great Prompt:

Use this four-layer structure for optimized prompts:

Layer 1: Scene Foundation - "A [emotional adjective] [subject] [action]. The setting is [specific location] with [environmental details]."

Layer 2: Photographic Technique - "Lighting: [light type] from [direction], creating [mood]. Camera: [camera type/angle], [lens details], [depth of field]. Composition: [framing], [perspective], [balance]."

Layer 3: Color & Style - "Color palette: [specific colors]. Art style: [reference or technique]. Mood/Atmosphere: [emotional quality]."

Layer 4: Quality Standards - "Quality: [professional standard]. Aspect ratio: [ratio]. SynthID watermark: [included by default]."

Common Pitfalls & Solutions:

| Pitfall | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| "Cat picture" | "A fluffy orange tabby cat with bright green eyes, sitting on a sunlit windowsill, looking out at a snowy winter landscape" |
| "Nice landscape" | "A dramatic mountain vista at golden hour, with snow-capped peaks reflecting in a pristine alpine lake, stormy clouds parting above" |
| Keyword list | "A cozy bookshelf scene: worn leather armchair, stack of vintage books, reading lamp with warm glow, fireplace in background" |
| Vague style | "Shot with 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field (f/2.8), film photography aesthetic, warm color grading, 1970s nostalgic feel" |
